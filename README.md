Recommending preferred contents to TV enthusiasts for media companies such as Netflix, YouTube TV
or Amazon Prime is crucial. There is a need to automatically tag metadata for content on those 
platforms to help with data analysis and organization across their users and personalize
recommendations. The goal therefore is to train a neural network on a convolutional neural network 
(CNN) architecture to be able to predict celebrity given an image as an input.

Data Source
The dataset is Pins and is hosted on Kaggle, lick here. The dataset contains about 17534 images of 
around 105 celebrities. Images are in different sizes and colored. I have written my own code to convert 
images of 10 celebrities (1006 images in 10 classes) to 35x35 grayscale images. To see the code of the 
used approach, please click here. In this link, python file 00.py is only for preprocessing and converting 
10 classes. You do NOT have to run this code as the results are already saved.
