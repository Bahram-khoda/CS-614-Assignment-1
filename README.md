Pitch
Recommending preferred contents to TV enthusiasts for media companies such as Netflix, YouTube TV 
or Amazon Prime is crucial. we have implemented Collaborative filtering that uses the preferences of a 
group of users to make recommendations for those users. The goal therefore is to train a neural 
network to predict ratings on unwatched movies by users, then, media companies can recommend 
those movies that get the highest predicted ratings to their users.
Data Source
To build this recommender system, we train our model on the ratings data in the ml-20m dataset. The 
ml-20m dataset contains over 20 million ratings of movies by users, as well as additional information 
such as movie titles and user demographics. To get the dataset on grouplens.org click here. To get the 
data (only ratings.csv) from my personal google drive, click here.
